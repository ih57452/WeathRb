A Ruby-Processing program to view NEXRAD level 3 radar data. It only supports viewing of reflectivity data from the WSR88Ds right now. To run use 'rp5 run weath.rb'. It either needs to have a data file (sn.last) in the same folder as the script, or you can uncomment the site_id variable in the script to have it load the latest data file from the internet.
