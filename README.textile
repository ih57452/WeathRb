h2. WeathRb
p.A "Ruby-Processing":http://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing program to view "NEXRAD":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexrad "Level-3":http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/radar/radarproducts.html#lvlproductlist radar data.
Right now it's only at a 'working preview' stage and only supports viewing of reflectivity data from the WSR88Ds.


h2. To Run
p. Get the Ruby-Processing gem if you don't already have it: <pre>gem install ruby-processing</pre>
Then use Ruby-Processing's <pre>rp5</pre> command: <pre>rp5 run weath.rb</pre>
It either needs to have a data file (sn.last) in the same folder as the script, or you can uncomment the <pre>site_id</pre> variable in the script to have it load the latest data file from the internet.


h2. Goals (TODO)
p. *Support all level-3 data formats (including TDWR data)
p. *Ability to export the image as a KML (Google Earth) overlay
p. *A map background
p. *Zooming and panning
p. *Better image smoothing
p. *Multiple-radar mosaics
p. *3D viewing of multiple tilts
p. *Ability to import KML overlays



p. Inspired by the "Geo::Nexrad":http://sourceforge.net/projects/nexrad-perl Perl module.
